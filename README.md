# John Hardy's VIM dot files

This is my personal traveling VIM/NVIM configuration.
It contains all the plugins that I use referenced as git submodules
and also my .vimrc customizations over the years.

I do heavy development on Linux systems using primarily MAC OS X and Linux Mint/Ubuntu
The main languages I focus on are PHP, JAVSCRIPT, HTML, CSS, BASH/ZSH, PYTHON, ANSIBLE-YAML

My configuration is taylored for 24bit True color terminals but should work on 16bit and 256color terms as well

I use pathogen for plugin configuration.
Here are the plugins, colorschemse and lang packs currently deployed in this repo
